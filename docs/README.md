## Motivatoin

  Live broadcast is getting more and more popular nowadays, and it became an important part in social media.
  But there's a big problem -- the field of view is highly restricted, the user can only see the part where the broadcaster shows them.
  So we want to craete a new experience in live broadcast, enabling users can interact more with each other.
  
## Introduction

  With the growing popularity of VR (Virtual Reality), we decide to borrow the idea of it, and integrate in the live broadcast. We want to enable user to change their point of view actively while live broadcast, see whereever they want, enjoy more fun with friends.
  We want to make a product as illustration below: the little camera can record videos, and rotates according to the movement of the user's head, and he/she can watch the live video in the HMD (head-mounted display)
